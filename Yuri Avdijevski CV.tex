\subsection*{Profile}

As a mid-level web engineer, I possess extensive experience in developing and maintaining complex web applications. I have a solid understanding of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have hands-on experience in using front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.

My expertise also extends to back-end development, including server-side technologies like Node.js and Express. I have a strong grasp of database management systems like MongoDB, data query language and data manipulation language for APIs like Graphql and Apollo and I am comfortable working with RESTful APIs to connect front-end and back-end components..
